In 2010 the TUDOR watch brand launched an ambitious project to develop its industrial production capacity for mechanical movements. <br>
To this end, the brand brought together a group of experts and presented an initial calibre manufactured by TUDOR at Baselworld in 2015, in variations to equip two different watches.

The following year the Genevan watch brand created the Kenissi company to oversee the development and production of its movements and, in parallel, offer its technical expertise in the field of movements to third-party brands. <br>
The first industrial partnership was then forged with Breitling. As its business developed, in 2018 Kenissi then formed an industrial alliance with Chanel, supplying the calibre for its new J12.

Today Kenissi offers a wide range of self-winding movements derived from the TUDOR Manufacture calibres. <br>
These customisable, high-performance, highly robust movements are entirely developed and produced in Switzerland.
